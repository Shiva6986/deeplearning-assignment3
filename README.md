main()


Question2:
Using NumPy we have created the random vector of size 20 having only float in the range 1-20
random20=np.random.random_sample(20)*20+1
Then we have reshaped the array to 4 by 5
random20.reshape((4,5))
Also we have replaced the maximum in each row by 0 with axis=1 
replace _maximum(random20_4by5,0,1)
Called their functions
if_name_=="_main_":
main()
